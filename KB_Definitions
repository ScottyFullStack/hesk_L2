Incident Management

The following is from Axelos ITIL Foundation V4 and not my own words.
Incident = an unplanned interruption to a service or reduction in the quality of a service.
The purpose of the incident management practice is to minimize the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible.
By gathering specific information about incidents organizations can set priorities and improve the service value chain.

Escalations

Axelos ITIL Foundation V4 defines Escalation as:

“The act of sharing awareness or transferring ownership of an issue or work item.”

Hesk has a dedicated module for escalations in their cloud and paid versions. You can find more information at http://localhost:8000/admin/module_escalate.php

This module will help you escalate tickets that are not attended to on time.
Tickets not assigned, replied to, or resolved within a timeframe,
tickets approaching due date and overdue tickets,
automatically change ticket priority, re-assign a ticket, send an email notification,
apply rules based on ticket category, owner, status,
and much more…
The escalation process here completely revolves around customer service and ticket hygiene.
